-- Beginner to pro, Episode 1
-- printing, simple strings

-- print has some basic functionality
-- outputs the specified string into output
-- A string is anything that is between "", '', or [[]]
-- for example: "This is a string", 'This is a string', [[This is a string]]

-- Make sure you have your output window open.

-- Also the double dashes im using means a comment, something that wont effect your code.
-- this means that if I press run this script will do nothing since this is all comments.

-- You can also write comments between --[[]] like that
-- ex:

--[[
	this is a block comment
]]

-- lets start with printing. This script will be in a github repository (in the description)
-- along with other scripts done in more videos.

-- Also note that my colors will be different than yours!
-- The text colors don't matter, just follow this tutorial as intended.

print("Hello, World!") -- this should say Hello, World! in the output!

-- make sure your output window is open so you can see the printed text.

-- As I said earlier, you can write strings in different ways

print('Hello, World!')

-- Here is the block string:

print([[Hello, World!]])

-- this should print hello, world! 3 times since they all do the same thing.
-- As you saw, it worked!

-- I did say they are block strings which means

print([[This 
Is 
Multi 
Lined]])

-- You can have multi lined strings!

-- there are different ways of printing too! More will be explained in more advanced
-- videos. Here are some more versions of print:

warn("This is a warning")

-- it works the same way, it supports all 3 versions of strings!

-- the last way of printing is error()

error("This is an error!")

-- I recommend using normal quotes for strings since you will use single quotes and brackets
-- more often.

-- when I press play you will see orange text and red text

-- this is where the tutorial script ends
-- make sure ot like and subscribe, stay tuned for more videos in this series!
-- github repository in description of the video!
